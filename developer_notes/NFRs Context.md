**I. Performance and Scalability:**

1. **How quickly do artists expect to upload and retrieve release artifacts (artwork, audio, videos, lyrics)?** Uploads should complete within 2 minutes,Retrieval should be within 30 seconds  
2. **How many artists do you anticipate using the platform concurrently, especially during peak release periods?** For MVP, 1 to 2\. Post MVP up to 10\.  
3. **What is the expected size of typical release artifacts (audio files, video files, high-resolution images)?** Where possible I will reformat images and audio, and cache for future requests from the one set of original artefacts. Typical size per release is 5GB \- 10GB.  
4. **How many releases might an artist manage simultaneously?** 1 to 2\.  
5. **What is the expected latency for accessing data across different geographic locations (if applicable)?** Up to 300% worse than local.

**II. Security and Data Integrity:**

6. **How sensitive is the release data (audio masters, artwork, lyrics)?** Protected security.  
7. **What level of access control is required for releases and their artifacts?** For MVP, only the artist will have access to a release. Post MVP additional users can be granted access.  
8. **How important is data backup and recovery?** Hourly backups.  
9. **Are there any specific security compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that need to be met?** No  
10. **How will you prevent unauthorized access to uploaded files and database information?** MVP strong password policies. Post MVP multi-factor authentication.  
11. **What is the desired level of data integrity?** Standard data validation and error handling.

**III. Usability and Accessibility:**

12. **What level of technical proficiency do you expect from the artists using the platform?** Relatively knowledgeable with social media platforms.  
13. **What are the key user experience goals for the platform?** Intuitive interface, easy navigation, clear workflows.  
14. **Are there any specific accessibility requirements that need to be met?** Post MVP WCAG compliance  
15. **How important is mobile responsiveness?** Post MVP the platform should be fully functional on mobile devices.  
16. **How will you ensure a consistent user experience across different browsers and devices?** Common back-end code and functionality, Model View Controller or similar design pattern.  
17. **How will the system handle error messages?** Clear, concise, and helpful to the user in both technical and non-technical language.

**IV. Reliability and Availability:**

18. **What is the expected uptime for the platform?** MVP 99% availability, Post MVP 99.9%  
19. **How will you handle system failures or outages?** Redundancy and near-line failover mechanisms.  
20. **How will you ensure data consistency in case of system failures?** Activity journaling.  
21. **How frequently will you deploy new features and updates?** Automated testing, unit testing, End-to-End behavioural testing, continuous integration and deployment are a must.

**V. Maintainability and Support:**

22. **How easy should it be for developers to maintain and update the platform?** Clean code, clear documentation. All code will be linted, auto formatted, type checked, and security scanned. Conventional Commits framework will be used to describe commits. Use of feature, hotfix and release branches will be used.  
23. **How will you monitor the platform's performance and identify potential issues?** Logging and operational performance dashboards.  
24. **How will you provide support to artists using the platform?** Documentation, FAQs, support tickets, contextual generative AI chat bots.  
25. **How will you handle software updates, patches, and security vulnerabilities?** Tools like Synk will be used to scan open source libraries and known CVEs, as well as scanning our code for security flaws. Prioritisation of updates and patches will be based on their severity and impact, addressing critical security vulnerabilities immediately. Communication of any critical security updates or vulnerabilities to users will be in a timely and clear manner. Use of tools such as Github dependabot, or other vulnerability scanning and dependency update tools will be used.

**VI. Compatibility and Portability:**

26. **What operating systems and browsers should the platform be compatible with?** Windows, Mac and Linux. Primarily Chrome and Chromium browsers will be supported.  
27. **Are there any specific file formats that need to be supported for artwork, audio, and videos?** Images in PNG and potentially other lossless image formats. Audio will be in FLAC. Videos will be H.265 (HEVC) or MP4.  
28. **How easily should the platform be able to be deployed to different cloud environments?** Unknown at this stage. Post MVP potentially utilising serverless functions like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions.
