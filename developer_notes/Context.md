**III. Technical Considerations:**

10. **Do you have any existing technical constraints or preferences?** Must be in Python.  
11. **What are your performance expectations for the software?** Reasonable but not ultra-fast response times, relatively scalable.  
12. **What are your security requirements?** User authentication, access control, approval workflows.  
13. **What is your budget for this project?** Initially an open source project with a plan to move to a Freemium funding model once matured.

**IV. Team and Resources:**

14. **What is the size and composition of your development team?** 1 developers, no frontend specialists.  
15. **What is your timeline for the MVP launch?** 3 months.  
16. **Do you have access to design resources for UX/UI design?** No

**V. Deployment and Maintenance:**

17. **Where do you plan to host the web application?** One of the cloud providers e.g., AWS, Google Cloud  
18. **How do you plan to distribute the mobile applications?** app stores, in-house distribution  
19. **What is your plan for ongoing maintenance and support?** Weekly cadence to monitor patching and security vulnerabilities.
